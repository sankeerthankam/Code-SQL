/*
Write a query to return each restaurantâ€™s average rating if they have more than 10 completed trips.
Ignore restaurants with fewer than 10 completed trips (not enough samples).
When computing the average rating, you need to first convert thumb_up ratings to the value of 1, otherwise 0.
In Postgres, to check if a boolean column is true, you can use IS TRUE statement.
When computing the average ratings, including ONLY completed trips.
