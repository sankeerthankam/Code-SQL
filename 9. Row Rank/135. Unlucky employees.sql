This is a follow-up question based on question 133 and question 134
First, identify departments with fewer than 5 employees.

Sort these departments by the total salary of its worker in descending order.

If there is a tie, the department with the greatest number of employees should go first.

If itâ€™s still not enough to break a tie, the department with the smallest id in higher rows.

Write a query to return the departments at the even row, so we can lay their entire department off.

Table 1: department 

Dimensional table for each department: sales, data science, hr, etc.

  col_name     | col_type
---------------+-------------------
id             | int
name           | varchar (20)


Table 2: employee 

Employee information, department they are in and their annual salary.

  col_name     | col_type
---------------+-------------------
id             | bigint
full_name      | varchar (100)
department_id  | int
salary         | float



Sample results

 id |      name      | num_employees | total_salary | row_number
----+----------------+---------------+--------------+------------
  2 | Sales          |             4 |       240000 |          2
  6 | Cloud Services |             2 |       130000 |          4
