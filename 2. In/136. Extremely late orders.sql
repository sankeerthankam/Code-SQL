/*
If a food order is delivered longer or equal than (>=) 60 minutes, this order is considered an 'extremely late order'.
Write a query to report the percentage of extremely late orders by month in 2021.
For simplicity, we assume every order was delivered.
The Postgres function to extract minutes from two time intervals: time_a and time_b  (time_b > time_a) is:
EXTRACT (EPOCH FROM time_b - time_a)::int/60
