Instructions:

Write a query to return the number of happy customers from May 24 (inclusive) to May 31 (inclusive).
Definition

Happy customer: customers who made at least 1 rental in each day of any 2 consecutive days.
Hint

For customer 1, you can create the following temporary table:
customer 1, first rental date, second rental date
customer 1, second rental date, third rental date
..............
customer 1, second last rental date, last rental date
customer 1, last rental date, NULL
As long as there is at least one row, where the delta of the last 2 columns are not null, and less or equal than 1 day, this customer must be a happy customer.
