This is a follow-up question to #192

Write a query to compute the average difference of the number of replies from the treatment group vs. control group for experiment 2001
Formula: (total number of replies for treatment group / total number of original tweets for treatment group) - (total number of replies for control group / total number of original tweets for the control group)
Original tweets are the first tweets to start a thread of discussions. i.e. reply_tweet_id are nulls
Table 1: tweets 

   col_name     | col_type
----------------+--------------------------
 user_id        | bigint
 tweet_id       | bigint
 reply_tweet_id | bigint
 created_at     | timestamp
 content        | varchar(280) -- max of 280 chars
Table 2: twitter_experiment_users 

Users that have been assigned into a treatment group or not for each ab testing. A user can only belong to either treatment or control group by a single experiment.

   col_name   | col_type
--------------+--------------------------
 exp_id       | bigint
 user_id      | bigint
 is_treatment | boolean
